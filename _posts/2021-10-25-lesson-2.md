# October 25 - A deeper dive into Python

Welcome to the third lesson of Woodlands Computer Science! We'll be taking a deeper dive into Python in this lesson by
exploring for loops, while loops, lists, and dictionaries.

## Review
In the last meeting, we covered:
- User input and output
- Booleans
- Conditional statements
- Indentation
- Else statements

Last week's interactive lesson is available at http://localhost:4000/group-a/2021/10/17/lesson-1.html.

Today, we'll be covering while loops, for loops, lists, and dictionaries.

## While loops

While loops are a type of loop in Python that allow you to run a block of a code *while* an expression/condition is
satisfield (i.e. evaluates to `True`).

The format of a while loop is as follows:

```
while <expression>
    <code>
```

The below code presents an example of a while loop in Python.

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-1">
counter = 0
while counter <= 6:
    print("The counter is equal to " + str(counter))
    counter = counter + 1
print("Finally, the counter is equal to " + str(counter))
</div>

We begin by defining a variable called `counter`. Then, the while loop's condition is `counter <= 6`, so the code that is indented as part of the while loop will run while `counter <= 6`. Inside the loop, `counter` is incremented and its value is printed to the output.

> Note that `<=` means "less than or equal to"

The code below presents a slightly more complicated usage of while loops.

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-2">
name = input()
while name != "Vishnu":
    print("The name is not Vishnu! It is " + name + ".")
    name = input()
print("The name is Vishnu!")
#####
Jeffrey
Marcus
Max
Nathan
Vishnu
Raymond
</div>

Notice how `The name is not Vishnu! It is Raymond.` is never printed to the output since the while loop terminates *before* `Raymond` is taken from the input and printed.

### Changing the flow of a while loop

The `break` and `continue` keywords can be used inside a while loop to change the flow of the loop.

`break` immediately terminates the loop and the first statement after the loop is executed. 

`continue` immediately skips the rest of the statements inside the loop and the loop is executed from the start.

Here's a diagram that demonstrates the difference between `break` and `continue`

## For loops

For loops are a type of loop that execute a block of code inside the loop for each element in an iterable. An *iterable* is something that has elements that can be *iterated*.

Iterate means go through or go over. Imagine you have a deck of cards. By going through each card, you are *iterating* the deck of cards. Examples of iterables include lists and dictionaries. We'll be going over the basics of lists and dictionaries in this lesson. But first, let's talk about for loops!

The format of a for loop is as follows:

```
for <variable> in <iterable>:
    <code>
```

Where `<variable>` contains the current element of the iterable.

You can use the `range(start, stop, step)` function to generate an iterable containing numbers from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (exclusive) with the step `step`. A negative value for `step` indicates that the numbers will be generated in reverse order (stop must be less that start in that case).

Note that start and step are optional. If only one value is provided, then it will be assumed to be `stop`. If two values are provided, then they will be assumed to be `start` and `stop`, in that order.

If you've taken math, you can relate the `range(start, stop, step)` function with sigma notation.

$\large{y=\sum_{x=0}^{10} x^2}$

Note that $$y = 385$$.

The notation above would have the following for-loop equivalent.

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-4">
y = 0
# We put 11 as the stop since stop is exclusive (i.e. this iterates from 1-10)
for i in range(0, 11):
    y += i ** 2
print(y)
</div>

Here's an example of using range with a reverse step.

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-5">
for i in range(10, -1, -1):
    print(i)
</div>

## Activity

Write a program to iterate from `start` (inclusive) to `stop` (inclusive), where `start` and `stop` are two variables whose values are provided by the user. (Hint: use the `input()` function you learned about last week!).

Then, inside the for loop, output the current number!

Example (`>>>` denotes user input, everything else is program output):
```
Enter a starting number.
>>> 2 
Enter a stopping number.
>>> 7
2
3
4
5
6
7
```

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-6">

</div>

Now, try writing the same program using a while loop!

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-7">

</div>

## Lists

Lists are a data structure in Python that allow you to store elements. Lists are also an *iterable*, meaning you can use for loops to iterate the list.

Lists are defined using square brackets and can be assigned to a variable. You can also optionally place elements inside a list when it is defined through comma-separated elements. Below is an example.

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-8">
names = ["Jeffrey", "Marcus", "Nathan", "Vishnu", "Max", "Raymond"]
print(names)
</div>

To get certain elements of a list, you can use **slice notation**.

Below is an explanation of the different ways you can use slice notation to get elements of a list.

> Note that lists are 0-indexed, meaning the first element will have an index of 0.

Say our list is
```python
names = ["Jeffrey", "Marcus", "Nathan", "Vishnu", "Max", "Raymond"]
```

| Slice 	|           Description           	|     Example   	|
|:--------:	|:-------------------------------:	|:---------------------:	|
|    `names[i]`   	|   Returns the element in `names` with the index `i`.     	|  `names[0]` returns `"Jeffrey"` 	|
|    `names[start:stop]`    	|  Returns a new list with elements from the original list between the indexes `start` (inclusive) and `stop` (exclusive). |  `names[2:5]` returns `["Nathan", "Vishnu", "Max"]` 	|
| `names[start:]` | Returns a new list with elements from the original list from the index `start` to the end of the list. | `names[3:]` returns `["Vishnu", "Max", "Raymond"]` |
| `names[:stop]` | Returns a new list with elements from the original list from the beginning of the list to `stop` (exclusive). | `names[:5]` returns `["Jeffrey", "Marcus", "Nathan", "Vishnu", "Max"]` |
| `names[start:stop:step]` | Returns a new list with elements from the original list between the indexes `stop` (inclusive) and `start` (exclusive) with the step `step`. | `names[1:5:2]` returns `["Marcus", "Vishnu"]` |

<br>

You can also assign list slices. We'll be going over this in the example.

To count from the end of a list, you can use negative indices, where the last element in a list is at the index -1, the second last is at the index -2, and so on.

Below are some common in-built methods you can use on Python lists.

Say our list is
```python
names = []
```

| Method 	|           Description           	|
|:--------:	|:-------------------------------:	|
|    `names.append(element)`   	|   Adds `element` to the end of the list.     	|
| `del names[i]` | Deletes the element in the list with index `i`. |
| `names.insert(i, element)` | Inserts `element` into the list at the desired index `i`. |
|  `names.index(element)` | Returns the first index of the occurrence `element` in the list. If the element is not found, throws a `ValueError`. |
| `names.count(element)` | Returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the list. |
| `names.clear()` | Removes all elements in the list. |
| `names.extend(iterable)` | Adds every element of an iterable to the end of the list. |
| `names.sort(reverse=False, key=function)` | Sorts the list based on the value returned by function when each element is passed into it; optionally sorts in reverse order. |
| `names.reverse()` | Reverses the list |

Here's an example of using slicing, common list methods, and using a for loop to iterate through a list!

<div is="code-editor" id="editor-9">
names = ["Jeffrey", "Marcus", "Nathan", "Vishnu", "Max", "Raymond"]
names.append("Mr. Dutton")

# Remember types?
print("There are " + str(names.count("Raymond")) + " occurrences of Raymond in the list.")

# Why is it printing the names in reverse?
for name in names[::-1]:
    print("The current name is " + name)

del names[-1]
print("Max can be found at index " + str(names.index("Max")))
print(names[3:1:-1])
del names[-3:]

# Uh oh! Vishnu, Max, and Raymond are gone!
print(names)

names.extend(["Vishnu", "Max", "Raymond"])

# Now they're back!
print(names)
</div>
